## üö® Deployment Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Test all API endpoints work with production data
- [ ] Verify MongoDB connection string is correct
- [ ] Check all novel/chapter pages load properly
- [ ] Test bookmark functionality
- [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Test chapter navigation
- [ ] Ensure all images/assets load
- [ ] Check page loading speeds

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Build Fails**: Check TypeScript errors with `npm run build`
2. **Database Connection**: Verify MongoDB URI and IP whitelist
3. **Missing Data**: Ensure your MongoDB has novels and chapters collections
4. **404 Errors**: Check that all dynamic routes are working
5. **Slow Loading**: Verify MongoDB indexes on `novel_id` and `chapter_id`

## üìà Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Test thoroughly** - Browse novels, read chapters, test bookmarks
2. **Monitor performance** - Check loading speeds and errors
3. **Backup database** - Regular MongoDB Atlas backups
4. **Update README** - Add your live URL to the GitHub README
5. **Share with users** - Your webnovel platform is live!

## üéâ You're Live!

Once deployed, your LiveNovel platform will be accessible worldwide at your hosting URL. Users can:

- Browse your novel collection
- Read chapters with the clean interface
- Bookmark their progress
- Navigate seamlessly between chapters
